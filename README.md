# My very own, first vanilla JS webpage ever

## Getting Started

This is my single-page-website created with techologies like: HTML 5.0, CSS 3.0, JavaScript
language, Bootstrap template and jQuery library and Karma&Jasmine for testing purpose. It consists
of only one page, which is used in very nifty way by showing and hiding appropriate sections with css.

## Sections

Page consists of following sections:
* Homepage - simple welcome page.
* Calculator - which is capable of doing very primitive operations which is addition, substraction, multiplication and division. It can also counts factorial.
* Request - which sends a request and obtain data from local file, to fill table with them.

## Working with file

File, which data should be displayed in table, must be a JSON file.

Example of appropriate file:

```
[                                               

      {                                         
         "title":"Hrabia Monte Christo",        
         "author":"Alexander Dumas"             
      },                                        
      {                                         
         "title":"Quo Vadis",                   
         "author":"Henio Sienio"                
      },                                        
      {                                         
         "title":"Ojciec Chrzestny",            
         "author":"Mario Puzo"                  
      }                                         

]     
```
